# TD1: Basic statistics in C++

## Overview

The goal of this TD(***travaux-dirig√©***) is to compute basic statistics(**standard deviation, covariance, correlation**) for variables in a ***.csv*** dataset. The folder contains the following files:

- the source file **stats_functions.cpp** which contains the main code
- the header file **stats_functions.hpp**
- the file **main.cpp**, which is used for the tests script
- a **Makefile** that you can use to compile these tests
- the file **stats.py** shows how similar computations could be made with ***pandas***.

It also contains some subdirectories:

- **csv** with the main dataset
- **grading** with the test scripts
- **gradinglib** with the test library.

## How to run the tests

Compile using the Makefile and then run **grader** executable generated.

`make grader`

`./grader`
