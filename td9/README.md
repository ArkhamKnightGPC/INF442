# TD9: Regression with a One-Layer Perceptron

## Overview

The goal of this TD(***travaux-dirig√©***) is to implement a 1-layer perceptron. The perceptron will have one hidden layer of neurons and one additional neuron generating the output.

The folder is structured into separate compilation units, each in a different sub-folder:

- **grading** with the test scripts
- **gradinglib** with the test library
- **quiz** with a python script used for the complementary quiz on Moodle (datasets are provided in the **csv** folder)
- the main files containing the code for the perceptron are in the root.

## How to run the tests

Compile using the Makefile and then run **grader** executable generated.

`make grader`

`./grader`
